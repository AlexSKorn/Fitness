                <h1>How It Works</h1>
                <p> During your checkout process, you will fill out a questionnaire providing details about your current stats (height, weight, age), your goals, lifestyle, and current diet / training. Based on this extensive questionnaire as well as a phone call, I will develop a plan for you.</p>
                <p>On a weekly basis, you will provide an email report to me on how the week went. You will provide information on bodyweight, training, and/or diet. I care about the qualitative details such as how you felt in and out of the gym and what your energy and motivation levels were. With this information, I will provide you with problem-solving suggestions as well as modifications to the plan as needed. In addition to the weekly report, I will be available to you via email, text message, and scheduled phone calls. If you have any questions you have come up with during the week, I will answer them as soon as possible (within 24 hours).</p>
