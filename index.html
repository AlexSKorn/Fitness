            <p>Hi, my name is <strong>Alex</strong>, I was a three-sport athlete through my Highschool (Hockey, Soccer, Baseball). I graduated with a degree in Computer Science from Gustavus Adolphus College. After my High School sports career, I caught the fitness bug and spent much of my free time reading the science behind nutrition and exercise. I have experimented on many different types of diets and training styles to maximize my performance in the gym and my health. Fitness has become my passion and I hope I can share that with you and make your fitness journey simple, enjoyable, and stress-free. </p>
            <p>I am a science-based, results-driven fitness coach who stays up to date with the latest research on health and fitness. My diet and training programs are tailored specifically to for you to reach your goals, whether you are a beginner or at an advanced stage of your fitness journey. I am driven by my passion for fitness and to help other people lead a healthier more enjoyable life. I want to genuinely create long-lasting changes to your life. I will provide you with the knowledge, tools, and support you need to achieve the results you desire. With my science-based result-driven programs, I know you will be able to achieve what you never thought was possible.</p>
